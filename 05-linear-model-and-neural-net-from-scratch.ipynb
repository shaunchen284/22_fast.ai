A dummy variable is a column that contains a `1` where a particular column contains a particular value, or a `0` otherwise.

We'll create dummy variables for `Pclass`, even although it's numeric, since the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` correspond to first, second, and third class cabins - not to counts or measures that make sense to multiply by. We'll also create dummies for `Sex` and `Embarked` since we'll want to use those as predictors in our model.

One interesting point here is that we don't need a separate constant term (also known as a \"bias\" or \"intercept\" term), or a column of all `1`s to give the same effect has having a constant term. That's because our dummy variables already cover the entire dataset -- e.g. there's a column for \"male\" and a column for \"female\", and everyone in the dataset is in exactly one of these; therefore, we don't need a separate intercept term to cover rows that aren't otherwise part of a column.\n","\n","Here's what the multiplication looks like:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.000637Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-30T22:34:18.999409Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.009362Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.00847Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.000588Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["tensor([[-10.1838,   0.1386,   0.0000,  -0.4772,  -0.2632,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.0000,   0.2799,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.3625],\n","        [-17.5902,   0.1386,   0.0000,  -0.9681,  -0.0000,  -0.3147,   0.4876,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.4392,   0.0000,   0.0000],\n","        [-12.0354,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.4950,  -0.0000,  -0.3147,   0.0000,   0.0000,   0.2799,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.3625],\n","        [-16.2015,   0.1386,   0.0000,  -0.9025,  -0.0000,  -0.3147,   0.4876,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.3625],\n","        [-16.2015,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.4982,  -0.2632,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.0000,   0.2799,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.3625],\n","        [-11.1096,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.5081,  -0.2632,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.0000,   0.2799,  -0.0000,   0.2103,   0.0000],\n","        [-24.9966,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.8973,  -0.2632,  -0.0000,   0.4876,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.3625],\n","        ...,\n","        [-11.5725,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.4717,  -0.2632,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.0000,   0.2799,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.3625],\n","        [-18.0531,   0.0000,   1.2045,  -0.7701,  -0.0000,  -0.3147,   0.0000,   0.0000,   0.2799,  -0.0000,   0.2103,   0.0000],\n","        [-12.4983,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.5968,  -0.2632,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.3136,   0.0000,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.3625],\n","        [ -8.7951,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.7766,  -0.0000,  -0.3147,   0.4876,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.3625],\n","        [-11.1096,   0.1386,   0.4818,  -0.7229,  -0.0000,  -0.3147,   0.0000,   0.0000,   0.2799,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.3625],\n","        [-12.0354,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.7766,  -0.2632,  -0.0000,   0.4876,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.4392,   0.0000,   0.0000],\n","        [-14.8128,   0.0000,   0.0000,  -0.4905,  -0.2632,  -0.0000,   0.0000,   0.0000,   0.2799,  -0.0000,   0.2103,   0.0000]])"]},"execution_count":21,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["t_indep*coeffs"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["We can see we've got a problem here.

In short, this acts as if there's a separate copy of the vector for every row of the matrix, so it divides each row of the matrix by the vector. In practice, it doesn't actually make any copies, and does the whole thing in a highly optimized way, taking full advantage of modern CPUs (or, indeed, GPUs, if we're using them).
